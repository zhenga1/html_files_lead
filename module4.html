In this module, we will cover what you can do if sexual violence and sexual harassment (SVSH), relationship violence, stalking, and/or invasion of sexual privacy comes up in your organization and how you can prevent it. We recognize that this is a heavy topic and we want to provide the following content warning:
<br/>
<div class="info">
    Take care of yourself as you move through this module - take a break if you need or want to. We recognize that reading about SVSH can be difficult, uncomfortable, and overwhelming.
    
    Ultimately, we want to focus on PREVENTING SVSH from happening by proactively addressing this issue and how you can create a healthy culture in your student organization.
    
    Statistics show that 1 in 3 women, 1 in 6 men, and 1 in 2 transgender folks experience SVSH. With that, we know there are survivors taking this course and survivors who participate in your student organization. We ask you to be mindful and thoughtful of your reactions to this content.

<div class="generalHeadingu">Creating a Culture of Consent</div>
<br/>
Sexual violence and sexual harassment (SVSH), includes sexual harassment, sexual assault, intimate partner violence, and stalking. SVSH are  fundamentally at odds with the university’s mission and principles of community. Preventing and responding to SVSH is a community responsibility. UC Berkeley takes a collaborative approach to addressing SVSH. 
<br/>
<br/>
Two principal partners in this effort are the Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination (OPHD) and the PATH to Care Center. 
<br/>
<br/>
The Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination (OPHD) is the campus Title IX Office. OPHD contributes to creating a culture of respect and consent by overseeing campus compliance with policies that prohibit discrimination and harassment for students, faculty, and staff, including those based on sex, gender, sexual orientation, race, disability, religion, and other protected categories. OPHD does this by receiving reports of harassment and discrimination, providing support to those harmed, and resolving matters either formally or informally. OPHD also conducts educational workshops for the campus community, often in partnership with the PATH to Care Center and other offices.
<br/>
The PATH to Care Center is a confidential resource that works to transform our campus into a community that is free of sexual violence, sexual harassment, intimate partner violence, and stalking through prevention, advocacy, training, and healing.  The PATH to Care Center envisions a campus community free of violence and grounded in social justice.  This vision will be realized when every member of our community is a beacon of support and respect for those around them.
<br/>
Please take a moment to watch, Creating a Culture of Consent and Respect at UC Berkeley, an informative video about the campus community's commitment to preventing and addressing Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment. The video is brought to you by the PATH to Care Center.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="generalHeadingu">Module Learning Outcomes</div>
<br/>
1. Integrate violence prevention strategies:
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We understand that each student organization has its own unique communities and environment. We would like you to think about tailored and "natural fit"opportunities to weave prevention into your student organization.
<br/>
2. Promote healthy & respectful interactions among peers:
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We all have the ability to change our campus culture to one that promotes prevention and respect. Throughout this module, we would like you to think about how you can be a part of this culture of respect as you learn more about consent and boundaries, positive social norms, and survivor support. 
<br/>
3. Respond if a member discloses experiences of violence:
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Check in with the survivor to make sure they are safe at the moment. If there are immediate safety concerns, discuss options of calling law enforcement or PATH to Care urgently. 
<br/>
4. Honor, respect, and believe the survivor. They are sharing with you for a reason, including that you are a trusted member of your community. 
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You might not occupy a leadership position – that is okay. Everything we review in this module are things you can personally do that will positively impact those around you, including the other folks in your student organization. If a disclosure occurs, we encourage you to warmly connect the survivor with the PATH to Care Center to explore confidential options and next steps. As a support person, you also have access to services from the PATH to Care Center and the Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination about reporting options, supportive and mitigating measures, and how your organization can respond to the impact of this disclosure and prevent future harm.
<br/>
5. Identify next steps, personally and for your student organization:
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We know you are seen as peer leaders, so people may come to you. It is important to have some basic information and skills so that you are prepared to respond effectively and compassionately.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="innerHeading">Your Role in the Organization</div>
<br/>
In this section, we will make sure you understand your role as a signatory in your organization. First and foremost, your organization plays an important role in creating a culture of care and concern. As a community member, you have the obligation to support your peers. However, remember it is not just you—others in your organization can also respond and/or support. Since you are in this training and taking on the responsibility of being a signatory, you do have a role of making sure others in your organization also have this information. 
<br/>
There are many long and short-term physical, psychological, academic, and economic impacts on survivors of SVSH. As such, student organizations can be important support places for survivors and be another touch point on campus where a survivor may turn when they need help. Your role as a signatory is to: 
<div class="info">
<div class="bolded">Build a sense of community:</div>
<br/>
We encourage you to provide access to information and resources. It may be difficult to know how and where to get help. You have the influence to create space where survivors can get connected to supportive resources, as well as incorporate those resources into the culture of your organization. 
<br/>
<div class="bolded">Offer peer-to-peer support:</div>
<br/>
Many survivors talk to peers before or instead of a staff member, confidential advocate, the police, etc. You may be the first person they share their experience with.
Keep in mind, you are not a “responsible employee”. Meaning, if a member discloses an incident of SVSH to you, you are not obligated to report to the campus Title IX Office or law enforcement. You should support the survivor’s decision about whether they want to make a report to OPHD or law enforcement or both. Please do not make that decision for them, or try to investigate the incident yourself. You can help by offering to connect the survivor with resources. We encourage you to reach you to the PATH to Care Center for support, resources, and options for both you and the survivor.
<br/>
<div class="bolded">Provide access to information/resources:</div>
<br/>
It can be hard to know where to get help. You have the influence to create a space where survivors can readily get connected to resources, as well as incorporate those resources as part of the culture of your organization.
<br/>
For urgent support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, please call the Care Line at 510-643-2005. If you receive a disclosure, you can offer to call the Care Line with the survivor. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Later in this module, we will provide you information on additional confidential resources such as the PATH to Care Center and the University Health Services.
<br/>
<br/>
    <div class="bolded">Promote Prevention:</div>
    
    Strengthen your leadership skills by learning more about preventing SVSH and all forms of harm. The next module offers detailed information about workshops and other prevention resources available to you.
</div>
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="generalHeading">Prevention Strategies</div>
<br/>
There are many opportunities to prevent violence before it happens, and many safe options to choose from to interrupt violence before it escalates. This section covers different prevention strategies you can start integrating today. You can also visit PATH to Care’s Prevention First webpage for additional resources and ideas, including workshops and consultations.

<br/>
<br/>
<div class="generalHeadingu">Promoting a Culture of Consent and Respect for Boundaries</div>
<br/>
<div class="info">
    Consent and boundaries matter in all contexts, not only sexual situations, from everyday moments such as asking before borrowing an item from a friend, to respecting the autonomy of your intimate partner to choose what to wear, who to talk to, and what to purchase.
    
    Create a group culture that respects boundaries by talking about them frequently and demonstrating respect for each others’ needs.
    
    Consider the ways that your student organization interacts when alcohol and other substances are  present. Do members get out of control, rude, or demonstrate disregard for boundaries when under the influence of substances?? It is never okay to use alcohol or other substances to lower someone’s inhibitions or initiate sex with someone who is incapacitated, AND being intoxicated is never an excuse for violating boundaries.
    
    Think about how your group’s environment influences the culture of your organization, including how you talk to one another, how boundaries are observed and respected, how power dynamics within the community influence interactions or someone’s ability to give consent/establish boundaries, etc. You can incorporate violence prevention into your organization’s procedures, processes, and policies such as the bylaws of your constitution.
</div>
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="generalHeading">Resources & Opportunities</div>
<br/>
Send interested members to the T.R.A.I.L. Prevention and Response Certificate Training which is a 6-hour course that provides deeper knowledge about SVSH for individuals who want to become ambassadors for prevention in their community 
<br/>
Request a peer educator workshop e from the PATH to Care Center)
<br/>
Bring in education, such as the PartySafe@Cal toolkit, on the role that alcohol can play in sexual assault
<br/>
Work with a consultant from the PATH to Care Center to identify improvements to organizational and community culture and incorporate violence prevention into your organization's policies or constitution.
<br/>
If you are a graduate student who is interested in building skills around SVSH prevention and restorative responses to harm you can apply to be a Diversity Fellow through the PATH to Care and Restorative Justice Center Graduate Ambassadors Program. Ambassadors will spend a year building skills and developing a range of interventions for their academic departments. If you are interested in this opportunity, reach out to pathtocare@berekeley.edu for information on the next application cycle.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="generalHeadingu">Bystander Intervention</div>
<br/>
<div class="info">
    Research shows that intervening in a concerning or problematic situation is a very effective way to prevent SVSH. Stop the harm, in the moment, before it escalates.
    
    The intervention can be direct or indirect. The key to bystander intervention is that you don’t have to be a superhero. You don’t have to solve everything about a situation, you just have to interrupt it enough to disrupt the behavior happening in the moment.
</div>
<br/>
<div class="innerHeading">Examples of direct intervention:</div>
<br/>
<div class="info">
    Role model ethical behavior by correcting your own imagery, jokes, and commentary that are sexist or demeaning
    
    Tell the person that their behavior is not acceptable or desirable
    
    Acknowledge to the person impacted and any bystanders that what happened isn’t ok
</div>
<br/>
<div class="innerHeading">Examples of indirect intervention:</div>
<br/>
<div class="info">
    Redirect the situation such as reminding everyone the purpose of the meeting
    
    Create a temporary distraction such as interrupting to ask about an unrelated topic
    
    Check in with peers who are present to determine a strategy
    
    Ask a peer who knows the people involved better to speak up
    
    Get help from someone in a position of authority or power
    
    Follow up later with the person who was impacted
</div>
<br/>
<div class="bolded">Resources & Opportunities</div>
<br/>
<div class="info">
    Request a workshop from Bears That Care
    
    Use group agreements during meetings that encourage acknowledging impact and engaging in bystander intervention.
    
    Create ongoing opportunities for members to practice bystander intervention skills
</div>
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="generalHeadingu">Changing Social Norms</div>
<br/>
Even if your student organization is not specifically an advocacy, wellness, empowerment or support organization, you and your organization still have the power to set standards for how people behave. This in turn will not only positively impact your group but also encourage a culture of respect and violence prevention in the wider Cal community. 
<br/>
Social norms are the unspoken rules about how we interact with each other. We learn these through observation and acculturation. For example, you probably learned to stand a few feet away when someone is getting money from an ATM through these methods. Social norms have a big effect on our sexual and relationship interactions, as well as cultural factors like gender roles, sexist bias, and victim-blaming.
<br/>
How we perceive the norms of our community can influence our behaviors, even when we don’t agree with those messages. What kinds of messages do your members communicate informally about sexuality, relationships, gender, and power? 
<br/>
There are many ways to communicate positive norms that can help counter unhealthy messages such as: 
<br/>
<div class="info">
    Setting group agreements that encourage bystander intervention, practicing self care, making space for everyone to be able to equally participate, etc.
    
    Intentionally creating a culturally competent space in your organization that respects cultural diversity and vales inclusion
    
    Centering consent in all interactions
    
    Setting expectations for behaviors at social events in invites.
    
    Visual messaging.
    
    Programs and events can promote health norms through party themes, specifically events focused on this topic, or an SVSH-related volunteer opportunity.
</div>
<br/>
<div class="bolded">Resources & Opportunities</div>
<br/>
<div class="info">
    Apply for the annual Social Norms Seed Grant to get funding and support for creating your own customized social norms campaign
    
    Work with a consultant from The PATH to Care Center to address the social norms in your student organization
</div>
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="generalHeading2">Scenario</div>
<br/>
Now we will shift gears to put some of what you’ve learned today into practice with a scenario. Please reflect for a moment on how you would intervene in the following situation.
<br/>
One of your members keeps posting sexist memes and jokes in your group chat. Some people laugh and brush it off as “that guy.” Others are uncomfortable saying anything.
<br/>
How can you prevent harm from escalating or continuing? 
<br/>
What types of changes might you consider making to the organization’s culture, practices, policies, and environment in order to discourage this and other unhealthy behavior?
<br/>
In the above scenario, the member is engaging in harmful behavior that prevents a climate of respect and consent. Remember that the CARE Model suggests actions you could take including: confronting the situation directly, seeking help, redirecting, or intervening in other ways to create an accountable, safe organization. 
<br/>
The important message we would like you to take away is that each member has the ability to change the culture so that this behavior is discouraged. The PATH to Care Center can consult with your student organization on culture change strategies and you can apply for a Social Norms Seed Grant to put together a positive social norms messaging campaign!

<h1>
    Supporting Survivors
</h1>
<br/>
This section will review options you have if a survivor discloses an instance of SVSH to you.
<br/>
<div class="info">
    What Do You Say?
<br/>
    Options for Action
</div>
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="innerHeading">What Do You Say?</div>
<br/>
If someone shares their experience of SVSH with you, start with the following: 
<br/>
Listen: Just listening to someone goes a long way
<br/>
Believe them: So does saying “I believe you”
<br/>
Make sure that you are in a quiet and private location if possible
<br/>
Try not to ask questions that might place blame on the survivor, like why something happened or what they were wearing; there is no need to investigate or determine if an incident happened
<br/>
Remember the decision to report, to tell someone, to seek counseling, etc. is that of the survivor’s 
<br/>
Maintain privacy and ask for the victim’s consent if you feel the need to get help yourself
<br/>
Offer resources if they want them, such as sharing the number to the 24/7 urgent support through the CARE Line (510-643-2005) 
<br/>
<div class="bolded">Try the Following…</div>
<br/>
Because it might take you by surprise or bring up a lot of emotions for you, it’s common for people to respond with “What happened” or something else that is hurtful. If you say something like that, catch yourself, apologize, and come back to one of these other supportive statements. Here are some ways to respond that show support and can be meaningful for someone to hear after they disclose to you.
<br/>
There is no perfect script! Try saying...
<br/>
Thank you for sharing this with me
<br/>
I’m sorry this happened to you
<br/>
It’s not your fault
<br/>
You are not alone
<br/>
There is help available
<br/>
Would you like to call PATH to Care’s CARE Line together?
<br/>
<div class="bolded">If You Mess Up…</div>
<br/>
If you mess up, simply pause and reframe with one of these instead:
<br/>
“Why do you say it was sexual assault? Hold on, sorry, that sounds like I don’t believe you. What I mean is that I do trust you and I’m here for you.”
<br/>
<div class="bolded">Takeaway Point</div>
<br/>
Remember to breathe and that listening and telling someone you believe them can go a long way. Do not pressure them to do anything they are not ready for. Connecting with a confidential resource like the PATH to Care Center is always a good first step, either for you or for them. You and the person who disclosed to you may also decide to talk to LEAD Center advisors - just remember that LEAD Center advisors are responsible employees and are required to report anything that you disclose to them about sexual violence and sexual harassment to the Office for the  Prevention of Discrimination and Harassment. That doesn’t mean LEAD Center advisors can’t help you, we simply want you to be aware. If you’re unsure about what help you need, going to a confidential resource first is usually a good idea.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="innerHeading">Options for Action</div>
<br/>
We’ve seen orgs take action with good intent, but this can actually cause further harm by continuing to disempower the survivor and violate their consent. We know accountability is important to you in your organizations, and we want to make sure you center survivors and allow the people who are trained to investigate and adjudicate to take those actions. 
<br/>
In Prevention Strategies, we reviewed strategies you can take to prevent harm in the first place and how to address lower-level behavior before it reaches a policy violation as a strategy for accountability.
<br/>
Here are some possible actions you can take in the moments after someone discloses an experience of sexual violence and/or sexual harassment to you:
<br/>
<div class="bolded">In the First 24 Hours:</div>
<br/>
<div class="info">
    Affirm the survivor, connect them to the PATH to Care Center (24/7 urgent support is available at 510-643-2005)
    
    Seek support for yourself from the PATH to Care Center
    
    Reach out to the LEAD Center and/or an advisor
    
    Review your constitution and policies on SVSH to ensure you are following protocol
    
    Protect the survivor’s confidentiality and privacy
    
    Ask the survivor what they need
</div> 
<br/>
<div class="bolded">In the Following Weeks:</div>
<br/>
<div class="info">
    Check in and respect the survivor’s requests are maintained by you and members of the student organization
    
    Maintain confidentiality
    
    Follow guidance and protocols for accountability
    
    Continue your own self-care
    
    Review your constitution and policies on SVSH. If updates need to be made, please consult LEAD Center advisors and PATH to Care Center staff.
    
    Regardless of how much time has passed since the incident, the PATH to Care Center is a confidential resource available to support the survivor and any concerned supporters.
</div>
<br/>
In your attempt to keep your organization members safe, accountable, and support survivors, please remember that it is not your role as a signatory or student organization leadership to investigate incidents of SVSH. This is the responsibility of trained professionals. PATH to Care Center staff and LEAD Center advisors are here to support you and your membership through SVSH related concerns.
