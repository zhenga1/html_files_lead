    CalLink is UC Berkeley’s official database for Registered Student Organizations. Although you may use google drive, email, social media, or others apps to manage your organization, we encourage you to also use CalLink for the following reasons:
    <br/>
    <div class="bold">Registration</div> | The university recognition process for all student organizations is administered through CalLink. Your "active status" in CalLink gives your student org the rights and privileges associated with recognition.
    <br/>
    <div class="bold">Recruiting</div> | All new students are directed to CalLink to find community in student organizations. Prospective members can browse by organization category to find groups to join.
    <br/>
    <div class="bold">Event Publicity</div> | Post your RSO events and info sessions on the CalLink events page.
    <br/>
    <div class="bold">Manage Your Org</div> | You can manage membership, communication, documents, elections, and finances via the CalLink tools.
    <br/>
    <div class="bold">Access Your Finances</div> | Orgs with funding can use the CalLink finance tools to create and approve CalLink purchase requests. Your org must be ASUC sponsored and have agents to use this service.
    <br/>
    <div class="bold">Official Communication</div> | The LEAD Center sends all RSO information to signatories roster positions in CalLink. This includes registration info, Calapalooza & Cal Day sign ups, funding opportunities, workshops and more.

<div class="generalHeading">How to Navigate CalLink</div><br/>
<div class="generalHeading">CalLink | Access & Manage Your RSO Funds</div><br/>
<br/>div class="bold">ASUC Sponsorship</div> | If you've received funding from on campus funding sources like the ASUC, the Graduate Assembly, campus departments, or campus grants, your funds will be deposited into your org's CalLink finance account. In order to utilize the CalLink finance tools, your org will need to be ASUC sponsored. The ASUC student government has fiduciary responsibility for RSO funds in CalLink. Like university recognition, ASUC sponsorship must be renewed annually.
<br/><div class="bold">CalLink Finance Agent Training bCourse</div> | After confirming your ASUC sponsorship, you will also need to identify who will manage and approve your organization's financial purchase requests in CalLink. This role is called a financial agent and is separate from signatory status. To get financial agent status, a student must complete the Callink Finance Agent Training bCourse, linked at the homepage of callink.berkeley.edu. Once the course is completed, the "ASUC/GA Agent User, Stage 2" position status will be added to the student’s CalLink membership roster. We recommend having a minimum of two financial agents in your organization. The SU Finance team manages financial agent status and provide a powerpoint of the material at FY23/24 CalLink Finance Training
 (Links to an external site.) to provide you with all the information you need to complete the Callink Finance Agent Training bCourse
 <br/><div class="bold">CalLink Finance Tool & Purchase Requests</div> | You'll use CalLink to manage the funds you've acquired through the ASUC/Graduate Assembly, campus department(s), campus grants, and donations. The most common use of CalLink's Finance feature is the "Create New Request" button (highlighted below) to create a Purchase Request (PR). You'll click here when your organization needs to submit a purchase request to pay for your contracted performers, vendors, campus departments, and reimbursements. You can also use this feature to check out a credit card, pay an invoice, an honorarium, stipend, purchase order and more. The FY23/24 CalLink Finance Training
 <br/>Links to an external site shows you how.
 <br/>Additionally, you can see your remaining balance and account information. This information is helpful when submitting your purchase requests to the ASUC Student Union Business and Finance office. They manage the Accounts Payable / Accounts Receivable (AP/AR) office window adjacent to the LEAD Center front door on the fourth floor of Eshleman Hall.
 <br/>⚠️: This orientation will give you signatory status which is different from being an authorized ASUC/GA financial agent. If you need to access your RSO funds in CalLink, please be sure to complete the 2023-24 Callink Finance Agent Training bCourse linked at the top of callink.berkeley.edu 

 <br/>
<div class="generalHeading">Policies Signatories Need to Know</div>
<br/>As a signatory, it is important to know the key university policies. We don't expect you to memorize all the policies below. The LEAD Center advises you to familiarize yourself with each policy and identify which policy might pertain to your organization. Please feel free to use this section as a reference list when you need it. 
<br/><div class="note">
    <br/>  Key University Policies
    
    <br/>  University Trademark Policy
</div>

<br/>For further understanding on the following policies, please feel free to contact your LEAD Center advisor at lead@berkeley.edu. 
<br/><div class="generalHeading">Key University Policies</div>
<br/><div class="bold">Berkeley Campus Regulations:</div> An overarching set of regulations which govern aspects of campus organizations and non-affiliates, use of University facilities, and time, place, and manner of public expression. These regulations address the rights and responsibilities of guests/non-affiliates and members of the University community, including faculty, staff and students, and provide standards for sustaining this community. 

<br/>
<div class="bold">Major Event Policy:</div> Policy governing “Major Events”, which is an event that has one or more of the following and is subject to review 6 weeks in advance of start date:
<br/>
1. 300 or more people are expected to attend;
<br/>
2. The event is a dance as defined by this policy or a concert featuring amplified sound, at which a majority of the audience is not seated;
<br/>
3. Alcohol is intended to be served, unless the event is a memorial service reception attended by fewer than 300 people or is an event at the Lawrence Hall of Science, the Botanical Garden, Blake House, or Anthony Hall; 
<br/>
4. Outdoor amplified sound is requested;
<br/>
5. Authorized campus officials determine the event is likely to significantly affect campus safety and security or significantly affect campus services other than those provided by the administrative unit making the event facility available;
<br/>
6. Authorized campus officials determine the event has a substantial likelihood of interfering with campus functions or activities other than the functions and activities of the administrative unit making the event facility available.
<br/><div class="generalHeading">Important! ⚠️</div>
<br/><div class="infored">You must submit the following documents (6) weeks prior to your event:</div>
<br/>
1. MEP event registration form
<br/>
2. UCPD Event Notification & Security Assessment Form
<br/>
3. A reservation request for your selected venue 
<br/>
Time, Place, and Manner on Campus: Like every university, Berkeley has its own carefully defined “time, place and manner rules” and other regulations governing individuals’ conduct on campus. These rules and regulations are designed to prevent substantial disruption of the University’s educational and other critical activities, protect lawful access to University programs and facilities, avoid unsafe behavior, and prevent the destruction of property.
<br/>
The Code of Student Conduct: A set of established rules of conduct intended to foster behaviors that are consistent with a civil and educational setting. The Code of Student Conduct applies to both individual students and to RSOs, where Signatories represent the RSO. Procedures are administered by the Center for Student Conduct.
<br/>
Nondiscrimination Policies: The University of California, in accordance with applicable Federal and State Law, does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including sexual harassment), gender identity, pregnancy/childbirth and medical conditions related thereto, disability, age, medical condition (cancer-related), ancestry, marital status, citizenship, sexual orientation, or status as a Vietnam-era veteran or special disabled veteran. This nondiscrimination policy covers student admission, access, and treatment in University programs and activities.
<br/>
Policies on Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violence: The University of California is committed to maintaining a community dedicated to the advancement, application and transmission of knowledge and creative endeavors through academic excellence, where all people who participate in University programs, activities and services can work and learn together in an atmosphere free of harassment, exploitation, or intimidation. Sexual violence, sexual harassment, retaliation, and other behavior prohibited by these campus policies interfere with those goals. This set of policies address university responsibility and procedures in addressing sexual harassment and sexual violence. 
<br/>
Statement on Hazing (Matt's Law): Matt's Law is a California law that allows for felony prosecutions when serious injuries or deaths result from hazing rites and also applies to our student organizations on campus. This bill increases the severity of charges for some hazing rituals, from misdemeanors to felonies, and for the first time gives prosecutors the ability to seek hazing charges against non-students. 
<br/>
Policy on Alcohol and Tobacco on Campus: Particular brands or manufacturers of alcoholic beverages and tobacco products may not be advertised or promoted either (a) on the Berkeley campus or (b) in conjunction with activities or events away from the campus that are sponsored by campus units or campus-recognized groups and attended by students.
<br/>
Use of Classrooms: When using classroom space, you must abide by the Classroom Use Policies or you may be denied from making future reservations.
<br/>
Campus Online Activities Policy: The Berkeley Campus Online Activities Policy establishes policy and offers guidelines where existing policies do not specifically address issues particular to the use of electronic resources. It also clarifies the applicability of law and of other University or Campus policies to online activities. 
<br/>
Environmental Health and Safety Policies: EH&S provides guidance and services to the entire campus community that promote health, safety and environmental stewardship. EHS issues food and special event assembly permits free of charge to keep RSOs and their guests safe
<br/>

<div class="generalHeading">University Trademark Policy</div>
<br/>We encourage you to familiarize yourself with UC Berkeley's Business Contracts and Brand Protection website. Here you will find the policies that list the do's and don'ts of using the UC Berkeley brand. 
<br/><div class="innerHeading">Swag and Custom Products</div>
<br/>
Your student organization may want to create custom items like pens and t-shirts with the name of your student organization. If the name of your student organization includes Berkeley, California, or any trademarks of the University, your student organization must use a licensee. Otherwise, the LEAD Center strongly advises you to use a licensee. A licensee has met the University’s standards to produce custom products. The University’s standards include fair labor practices, ethical sourcing, and meeting employment standards.
<br/>
You can find a list of available licensed companies under the heading Use of UC Berkeley Trademarks & Licensees for Student Group Use. Please go to the Licensees for Student Group Use. 
<br/>
<div class="innerHeading">Your RSO's Name</div>
<br/>
Under the Berkeley Campus Regulations, registered student organizations are not allowed to use the intellectual property of the University  in the name of the student organization and in the nicknames of the student organization. Berkeley, Cal, California, Golden Bear, Bear, Bears, Oski, the names of Campus Buildings or Spaces, and other University trademarks, logos, etc. cannot be incorporated into a student organization’s name as they are the intellectual property of the University.
<br/>The University has granted permission to registered student organizations to use the word "Berkeley" or the word "California" as part of a student organization in the following format: "Student Organization at/of Berkeley" or "Student Organization at/of California". 
RSOs who were grandfathered-in prior to the 2009 policy change can continue to use the University trademark in their name (for example: Cal Debate and Cal Dragon Boat).
Brand Protection and Licensing and the LEAD Center manage the University’s name and intellectual property  in order to protect the University’s brand of education, quality, and excellence.
<br/>
Any use of University name and intellectual property (including trademarks, logos, images, etc.) requires the explicit permission and authorization of the University through both the LEAD Center and the Licensing Program at UC Berkeley (for products like t-shirts) or the LEAD Center and Berkeley’s Business Contracts and Brand Protection Office for all other uses. Trademark requests are not guaranteed to be approved. 
<br/>
When branding your organization, we encourage you to use your original artwork, design a unique logo, select distinct colors (can use blue and gold), and create a slogan.  If you have any further questions, please contact your LEAD Center advisor. 
<br/>
<div class="innerHeading">Risk Management</div>
<br/>
Risk exists at different levels for anything your student organization may do. Risk can appear in a variety of programs from a cooking demonstration to an outreach event working with youth. We encourage student organizations to proactively prepare for risk in order to protect your participants, members, and your organization. 
<br/><br/>
This section will review different risk considerations, policies, and insurance for your organization's event(s).

</div>

<br/><br/>
<div class="innerHeading">Insurance for Your Events </div>
<br/>The LEAD Center advises student organizations to get insurance so that you can protect yourself and your organization from financial and legal consequences. We recommend that you ensure that your organization's events are covered by insurance and you do your due diligence to mitigate potential risks and accidents such as bodily injury, harm to others, and damage to your property and campus property.
<br/>At UC Berkeley, UC Office of the President (UCOP) pays for insuring (most) student organization events on campus already. This is a benefit to you! To qualify for the RSO Insurance program, you must be fully registered with the university via the LEAD Center.
<div class="info">

    Organizations holding low-risk events are automatically covered.

    Organizations holding high-risk events need to obtain additional coverage.

    Use the UC Hazard Chart

    Links to an external site to reference risk and coverage categories for certain event types.

</div>

Low-Risk Events
High-Risk Events
Meetings
Lectures
Receptions 
Seminars 
Teleconferences
Minors under the age of 18
Animals
Sports or other athletic activities
Performances of any kind
Moving vehicles
Tools, weapons, or heavy equipment
Fire (including cooking)
High attendance in an outdoor venue

 
To recap, low-risk events on campus are free to you as a student organization. Insurance for a high-risk event on campus may come out-of-pocket from the student organization. UCOP does not cover off-campus events, but an off-campus venue may still ask for coverage.

If you have any other questions about risks related to your event, please feel free to contact your LEAD Center advisor. 

<br/>
<div class="innerHeading">Events with Minors</div>
<br/><div class="infored">
    ⚠️: Any event(s) with minors (children and students under the age of 18) requires you to meet with your LEAD Center advisor.
</div>

<br/>If your organization is hosting an event with minors, LEAD Center advisors will work with you to ensure that your organization is taking the necessary steps to protect your organization and participants under the age of 18. 

<br/>We love hosting youth on campus just as much as you do. Yet, we must do all that we can to mitigate unintended impacts. We emphasize this because working with minors comes with a unique set of liabilities that are considered high risk. 

<br/>Note: Space reservations for events with minors will not be accepted without LEAD Center advisor approval. 
<br/>
We will work with you to make sure you’re protected and informed about all possible liabilities so that you and your participants can have a safe, meaningful, and successful event! 
<br/>
Resource: Volunteer Code of Conduct
<br/><div class="generalHeading"> 
    Waivers
</div>
<br/>
Waivers are written agreements that state that the sponsor of an activity will not be liable for harm suffered by participants. Waivers serve both as a legal and educational tool by calling on people to think about the potential risks of an activity. 
<br/>
Waivers should be used whenever you are sponsoring an event which involve the following: 
<br/><div class="info">
    
    Participants engage in performances, competitions, or other physical activities that could lead to injury (i.e. races, basketball tournaments, bounce houses, etc.)
    <br/>
    Participants use equipment like sound systems, movie projectors or tools
    <br/>
    Guests are take away from their home location
    <br/>
    Participants are minors (anyone under the age of 18)

. Be sure to check out their FAQ and Risk Worksheet if you're planning a high risk event.
<br/>If you have any other questions about insurance or waivers, please feel free to contact your LEAD Center advisor. 
 
<br/><div class="generalHeading">Hazardous Materials & Equipment</div>

<br/>
Does your organization engage in any experimentation or work with hazardous materials or equipment, including but not limited to acids, aerosol, batteries, biological agents, compressed gasses, chemicals, darkroom chemicals, lasers, fertilizers, mercury, radioactive materials, toxins, weed killer, etc.?
<br/>
Does your organization use any Physical Hazards/Equipment: shop power tools (drills, saws, presses, cutters, laser cutters etc.), power supplies, fabricated electronics (items not commercially purchased but made), 3D printers, soldering, welding, brazing, etc.?
<br/>
If your student organization works with any hazardous materials or equipment, we ask you to do the following:
<br/>
Notify the LEAD Center (lead@berkeley.edu) before starting any experiments, builds or practice sessions.
<br/>
Acquire insurance coverage for all RSO events, including "practice or experimental" sessions.
<br/>
Do not assume that working in a campus lab or maker space grants you permission for this RSO activity
<br/>
Get permission from campus spaces and faculty by disclosing your RSO activities and insurance requirements. RSOs have different requirements than an individual student working in a lab setting.
<br/>
Consult with The Office of Risk Services and The Office of Environment, Health & Safety before working with Hazardous Materials & Equipment.
<br/>
<h1>Event & Space Reservation</h1>
<br/>
Location, location, location! We understand that space is a necessity for the livelihood of student organizations. We all need space to host our meetings, events, and celebrations. 
<br/>
One of the privileges of RSO university recognition is the ability to host events and reserve venue spaces on campus. There are many venues on campus that are managed by individual departments. This page will review two of the most common ways RSOs reserve space on campus. Many campus venues have changed their reservation process since the pandemic. Please make note when reserving.

<div class="heading2u">Access to 25Live</div>
In order to reserve classrooms, you'll need to adhere to the following protocols: 
<br/>
<div class="info">
    - You must be an active signatory to reserve general assignment classrooms on campus.
    <br/>
    - Once you are an active signatory, you must request access to the classroom reservation software, 25Live  by completing the Signatory Request for Access to 25Live Room Request System document. You must complete this step before submitting a classroom reservation request on 25Live.
    <br/>
    - Should you have any difficulties troubleshooting 25Live access, submit a ticket here.
</div>
<br/>
<div class="heading2u">25Live Instructions</div>

<br/>
Once you've completed your request, see "Your Upcoming Events" in 25Live to reference a successfully created request(s) which can be found by clicking the "Create an Event" box. 
<br/>
<div class="heading2u">25Live Reminders</div>
<br/>
Please note that classroom space is limited and available on a first-come, first-served basis determined by the submission date and time of the request.
<br/>
As a reminder, when using classrooms, you must abide by the Classroom Use Policies or you may be denied from making future reservations. Please make sure you leave the room as you found it- clean and orderly. 
<br/>
The LEAD Center recommends that the signatory in charge of classroom reservations remains the primary point of contact for General Assignments (GA) Classrooms for the academic year. 
<br/>
If your request is denied, you must submit a new request and start over. The LEAD Center recommends that you supply alternate dates, times, and locations when making a request to avoid denials. 
<br/>
Visit the 25 Live Instructions document on how to make a successful request.
<br/>

<div class="innerHeading">Semester Limits on Reservation (20 Hours)</div>
Each semester, student organizations are allowed to reserve a maximum of (20) weekday hours per semester in General Assignment (GA) Classrooms.
<br/>
Example 1:
<br/>
Weekly one-hour meetings for (15) semester weeks adds up to 15 of the 20 allotted hours.
<br/>
Example 2:
<br/>
A meeting that takes place over (1) hour in three classrooms is calculated as 3 hours of the allotted 20 hours. 
<br/>
Alternative locations, such as the ASUC Student Union and campus libraries should also be considered if more time is needed.
<br/>
Scheduling Timeline: Month 1 (ie. Phase I) & Month 2-4 (ie. Phase II)
<br/>The scheduling timeline changes each semester. You will be updated regularly on the Classroom Reservations website.
<br/><br/>

    Funding Your Student Organization
</div>

<br/>Your organization's funds are important for covering your organization's annual costs. Although these costs range depending on your activities, the LEAD Center most commonly sees funding go towards event venues/spaces, supplies, performance artists, keynote speakers, transportation, and program materials. 
It is important to understand how to obtain grants and funding from a variety of campus resources as each funding source has its own set of policies and procedures. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with each financial process to ensure a smooth flow of funding into your org's CalLink account. 

<br/>There are many ways to get funding. This section will review the different funds available:

<div class="info">
    - Applying for funds through the ASUC or the Graduate Assembly
    <br/>

    <br/>
    - Finding sponsors, partners, or donors
    <br/>
    - Fundraising and crowdfunding
</div>
<br/>
Your organization must be recognized by the LEAD Center in order to be eligible for university, ASUC, or GA funding. Additionally, an organization must be sponsored by the ASUC in order to utilize the CalLink finance tools. If you seek to claim the ASUC's non-profit tax ID number for  fundraising, your organization must follow LEAD Center and ASUC policies and procedures, including being ASUC sponsored.
<br/>
For further information, please feel free to contact your LEAD Center advisor. Please visit our FAQs page on our website to see the most up-to-date info on common questions!

<br/>
<div class="innerHeading">ASUC Funds</div>
<br/>
The Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC) is responsible for allocating the fund collected as part of ASUC student fee. That fee is $33.50/semester for undergraduate students and $27.50 for Graduate and Professional students. All funds from undergraduate students go to the ASUC to allocate, and all funds from graduate and professional students go to the Graduate Assembly, a subsidiary of the ASUC. Both groups allocate funds to LEAD Center registered and ASUC sponsored student organizations.
<br/>
Student groups must be registered with the LEAD Center and have current ASUC sponsorship  in order to be eligible to apply for ASUC funds. To review how to get your organization sponsored by the ASUC, please visit  the “Fund Your Org” website. 

<br/>
After your Registered Student Organization is approved for sponsorship by the ASUC, your organization can apply for funding and space during the ASUC's Annual Budget and Space Allocation (ABSA) process. ABSA occurs during the Spring Semester when registered and sponsored RSOs can apply for funding and space for the following academic year. ABSA 2023-2024 funds have already been allocated so that process is complete and will not occur again until Spring of 2024. However, if your group missed ABSA allocations from Spring of 2023, your group can still apply for both Sponsorship and funding through the ASUC Senate Sponsorship Application and the ASUC Senate Contingency Fund Application which is only available from late August through Week 15 of Spring semester under CalLink ‘forms’
<br/>
ASUC funds are allocated to RSOs who apply through ABSA during the Spring semester. Registered Student Organizations must reapply for ASUC sponsorship every year through a CalLink form or by completing the ABSA application the previous Spring. Below is an estimated timeline but actual dates are set and publicized by the ASUC on CalLink and the ASUC ABSA Webpage

<div class="generalHeading">Senate Contingency Fund Process</div>
<br/>
Some ASUC funding is still available throughout the academic year if your organization was unable to request funding during ABSA or was not allocated a budget. The ASUC Senate Contingency Fund is allocated by application for Registered and Sponsored RSOs. This fund is for RSOs who feel need more funding than originally anticipated, who missed the ABSA deadlines, or for newly formed RSOs who missed the ABSA process the previous Spring. RSO's can apply for funding via the Senate Contingency Fund application process on Callink starting when classes begin in August and ending in the final week of classes in Spring.
<br/>
Your RSO must be ASUC sponsored to apply for Senate Contingency Funds. ASUC Sponsorship applications are also open on Callink starting when classes begin in August and ending in the final week of classes in Spring.

<div class="generalHeading">Fundraising</div>
<br/>
If you are conducting a fundraiser on campus please review the general guidelines at the LEAD Center Planning Events website and be aware of the following requirements: 
<br/>
If you are collecting cash donations or entrance fees, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our Cash Handling Guidelines.
<br/>
If you are selling food items, prepare to follow the Environmental, Health and Safety Food Guidelines and have applied for the EHS Food Permit at least 10 business days prior to ensure timely processing of necessary permissions
<br/>
Campus policy restricts commercial activity (see Article 122 of Berkeley Campus Regulations), specifically, “Recognized campus organizations must be non-commercial in nature, and the use of campus facilities by such organizations may not result in personal financial benefit to any individual or private enterprise”. How this policy applies to RSO fundraisers: 
<br/>
No student or student group is allowed to become a sales representative on behalf of a non-campus commercial enterprise. An arrangement to be a sales representative for a commercial entity may compromise the group's ASUC sponsored status within campus policy and jeopardizes their ability to maintain campus recognition.
<br/>
Please note that it is acceptable to buy a product (shirts, supplies, edible goodies following EH&S guidelines) at one price and offer it as a fundraiser for the benefit of the group.
<br/>
The LEAD Center requires that a fundraiser involve only transactions that are one-time efforts offered to clearly benefit the constitutionally defined purpose of the group, and marketed in such a way to maximize the group's benefit and minimize the commercial activity involved.
<br/><br/>

If a donor is requesting proof of nonprofit status or a Tax ID number in exchange for their donation, please fill out the Request for Use of the ASUC Non-Profit Tax ID Number form in CalLink.
<br/>
Crowdfunding at Berkeley is another great option to raise money for your organization. Students are able to set up month-long campaigns to raise money through the online portal.
<br/>
RSOs who wish to do larger fundraising campaigns and want to be able to accept online payments can sign up for an account with Give to Berkeley and/or also participate in the BIG GIVE, Berkeley’s one-day online fundraising campaign. This is your student group’s chance to solicit donations from members, friends, family, and more. To do this, you must make an appointment and discuss it with your LEAD Center Advisor.
