<br/>
We, as a campus community, are committed to the wellness of our students. UC Berkeley's holistic approach to wellness addresses the physical, emotional, social, intellectual, occupational, spiritual, and financial health of our community.
<br/>
The experience of leading an organization involves contributing to the wellness of the student experience by providing a co-curricular space where students can gain support and resources for their well-being. 
<br/>
The following will cover strategies and resources available to you at Cal:

<div class="innerHeading">Supporting a Member’s Wellness Related to Substance Use</div>
Most of us make smart choices about whether to use substances and avoid negative academic, physical, or social consequences. We also recognize that not everyone drinks or chooses to experiment with substances. With that said, we all play a role in creating a Party Safe culture at Cal. Here, we provide some resources to help you get informed and know what to do to support a member’s wellness related to substance abuse.
<br/>
PartySafe@Cal is a peer education prevention program through University Health Services—Tang Center. Please take a moment to watch, Party Safe and Here's How I Do It.
<br/>
While leading your student organization, if you face choices and situations related to alcohol and other drug use (your own, your members, your events) use the information and resources here to help you navigate and be well.  University Health Services Social Services offers confidential and non-judgmental counseling and consultation about your own substance use or that of a friend or family member.
<br/>
You can explore relevant harm reduction resources and actions for change on the Party Safe at Cal and Collegiate Recovery Program websites and by following them on instagram and facebook. Student leaders and members can email partysafe@berkeley.edu with non-emergency questions and concerns about substance use and culture.

<br/>
Wellness includes taking care of your mental health and being mindful of the mental health of your members. Remember, delegation and modeling self-care is also a part of being a leader and can help reduce stress. Additionally, delegation can provide opportunities to share the leadership experience so that more students can have an opportunity to try new things.

<div class="h1">Inclusion</div>
<br/>
Inclusion is the act of caring for all the members of the student community and creating a space where everyone can feel like they belong. There are some aspects of inclusion which we might already know and probably many other aspects that have never occurred to us. This section will help you dig deeper into inclusion and what it means for you and your organization.

<div class="bolded">Land Acknowledgement</div>
The LEAD Center acknowledges that UC Berkeley sits on the territory of xučyun (Huichin), the ancestral and unceded land of the Chochenyo speaking Ohlone people, the successors of the sovereign Verona Band of Alameda County.
<br/>
We recognize that every member of the Berkeley community has, and continues to benefit from, the use and occupation of this land, since the institution’s founding in 1868. Consistent with our values of community, inclusion, and diversity, we have a responsibility to acknowledge and make visible the university’s relationship to Native peoples. As members of the Berkeley community, it is vitally important that we not only recognize the history of the land on which we stand but also, we recognize that the Muwekma Ohlone people are alive and flourishing members of the Berkeley and broader Bay Area communities today.
<br/>
This acknowledgment was co-created with the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe and Native American Student Development and is a living document. Learn more about the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe.  
 
<div class="bolded">Reflections on Inclusion</div>
<br/>
Our students have a wide array of intersectional identities and communities at UC Berkeley. When was the last time you and/or your organization actively had a conversation about inclusion in your organization? What practices does your student organization have in place to make sure that everyone is included? 
<br/>
We encourage you to think of inclusion not as a destination nor a goal that your organization “arrives” at. Instead, it is a chance to view inclusion as a constant practice that changes with each new year and each new group of students. There is always room to grow and more to learn when it comes to topics of inclusion. 
<br/>
The following video created by the Gender Equity Resource Center provides tips for making classroom environments inclusive for everyone. Although, you may not teach a class, the video provides strategies for creating an environment in your organization that's inclusive for all students at UC Berkeley. 
<br/>
<div class="innerHeading">Creating LGBTQ+ Inclusive Classroom Climates</div>
<br/>
Inclusive practices require that we pause, reflect, and understand our social positionality within systems of oppression. As leaders, we trust that you will set the examples by interrogating the ways in which systems of oppressions such as, although not limited to, race, class, and gender shape your social world. By taking an inward look, we gain a better sense of how to take action against prejudices within our communities. 
<br/>
We hope you take the time to sit and reflect with these following questions. We trust that you will bring these questions back to your organization and facilitate dialogue among your group members. 
<br/>
<div class="notesBigUnderline">Questions to Consider:</div>
<br/>
<div class="info">
    How does my organization reflect on the complexity of our members’ identities and experiences? How can we reflect more?
    
    How is my organization inclusive of all our members’ identities and prospective members’ identities?
    
    How accessible is my organization to the campus community, both physically and financially?
    
    How does being more inclusive benefit my organization and its mission?
    
    What is my organization already successfully doing to create a welcoming space for all? What have we not tried  that we can try this year?
    
    What is my organization doing to have challenging conversations on inclusion?
    
    Who can we ask for support to increase inclusion in our organization?
    
    In addition to basic demographics and protected classes of identity, what are the life experiences of current and prospective members who  make up our student org?
    
    If you need support facilitating dialogues about inclusion, please do not hesitate to contact your LEAD Center advisor.

Greater Good magazine is published by the Greater Good Science Center (GGSC) at the University of California, Berkeley. Since 2001, the GGSC has been at the fore of a new scientific movement to explore the roots of happy and compassionate individuals, strong social bonds, and altruistic behavior—the science of a meaningful life.
<br/>
Greater Good Science Center's mission is to elevate the human potential for compassion. But that does not mean we deny or dismiss the human potential for violence, particularly toward marginalized or dehumanized groups.
<br/>
For centuries, African Americans and other communities of color have been subject to this physical and structural violence, denied their humanity and often their basic right to exist. That’s why we are gathering Greater Good pieces that explore our potential to reduce bias and contribute to racial justice. The science we cover reveals the considerable psychological and structural challenges we are up against. But it also gives hope that another world is possible.

<div class="generalHeading">Ways to Take Action </div>
<br/>
Have you ever been in a situation when you saw something that was wrong, but did not know how to respond? Taking action is one of the most important parts of your ethical responsibilities as a signatory. The situations you encounter will each require a different course of action. In this section, we will provide you with a toolkit for how to take action.
<br/>
<div class="info">
    Intent vs. Impact Model
    
    CARE Model
    
    Submit a Report
    
    Additional Resources
</div>
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="innerHeading">Intent vs. Impact Model</div>
<br/>
One place to start is by understanding Intent vs. Impact. While an individual may have good intentions, the impact of their actions may not always align with their intention. Especially in instances where potential harm may have occurred, it’s important to focus on the affected individual(s) experience of the harm (in other words, focusing on the impact).  
<br/>
A common example of this model is that of a broken glass. Someone moves by a table and accidentally knocks over their friend’s glass and breaks it. Even though that person’s intention was not to break the glass, the impact is still that the glass is broken. It’s important for the person who broke the glass to take ownership of their impact on their friend. 
<br/>
In an inclusion context, this model can be applied very broadly. For example, how might Intent vs. Impact be used to repair a relationship where an event requirement impacted someone negatively? Or, how might Intent vs. Impact be used to help a member understand how to take responsibility for a joke that had a harmful impact on another member? 
<br/>
This is a process. We all make mistakes and can be wrong, but the most important thing is to listen, reflect, apologize, and work to do better in the future.
<br/>
<div class="info">
    <div class="innerHeading">Scenario #1</div>
    
    Your organization is having a Fall retreat at an off-site location in the woods. One of your members, who uses a wheelchair, tells you that they didn’t notice any accessibility information in the flyer. They ask you if the retreat site will be accessible. They don’t want to make a big deal out of it and seem to emphasize that they don’t want to be a hassle. You don’t actually know the answer to this member’s question. What might you say and do?
    
    <div class="bold">Response:</div> You might consider expressing your intent and also taking ownership of the impact. For example, you might say: “I’m sorry, I actually don’t know the answer to that right now. My intention is for everyone to be able to participate, and I recognize that not having that information for you could have a negative impact on how you feel. I will work on this right away to get you the answer.” Then, figure out how you can take action to rectify the situation.
    
    <div class="bold">Learning Outcome:</div> To create an inclusive environment, you and your organization can make sure that the retreat is accessible to everyone that wants to attend. If you’re unsure, you can always ask a LEAD Center advisor for help. Ultimately, you might consider the concept of universal design; the best standard is to proactively think of inclusion before any plans have already been set so that everyone can already fully participate from the beginning.
</div>
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="innerHeading">CARE Model</div>
<br/>
<i>How can you support member’s safety? </i>
<br/>
<br/>
Bears that CARE is an active bystander initiative to make our campus safer. Bears that CARE helps us recognize and intervene in situations that have the potential to be violent or harmful.
<br/>
Before we can discuss how to take action, let’s look at why people may feel like they cannot intervene, and how to overcome these barriers. Common reasons that prevent students from taking action include:
<br/>
<div class="info">
    <div class="bold">Bystander effect:</div> “Someone else will handle it”
    
    We tend to assume that, if there are many people present, someone else will step in. However, when everyone makes this assumption, often no one takes action. As a leader, it is important that you take responsibility and act.
    
    <div class="bold">Evaluation apprehension:</div> “Maybe I’m misreading the situation”
    
    Sometimes we worry that there is something about a situation that we do not understand, and we are making it a big deal when it may not be. However, it is better to do something about a harmless situation, than to do nothing about a harmful one.
    
    <div class="bold">Victim blaming:</div> “They might have done something to deserve what’s happening”
    
    No matter how someone is dressed, how much they are drinking, or who they are, no one deserves to be harmed. Everyone deserves to feel safe on campus.
    
    <div class="bold">Misperception of norms:</div> “Other people seem to be okay with it, so I guess I shouldn’t say anything”
    
    We tend to underestimate how many people are uncomfortable with a situation, because everyone has the same misperception. Chances are, if you think it is not okay, others agree, and would feel relieved and offer support if you take action.
</div>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now let’s use the CARE Model in action! The CARE Model is not meant to be a step by step set of instructions but rather a menu list of options you have to safely intervene as an active bystander to help make the community a safer and welcoming space for all. There are many different ways to intervene to help take care of our fellow bears! 
<br/>
Here are some examples of ways to use the CARE Model to help others:
<br/>
<div class="bold">Confront the Situation:</div> Calling out a friend for a microaggression, “Hey, what you said was harmful because X”
<br/>
<div class="bold">Alert Others:</div> Talking to the party host about a student who passed out, “I’m worried about this person who passed out, can you check on them to see if they are alright?”
<br/>
<div class="bold">Redirect Attention:</div> Seeing an argument between a couple get heated and coming up with an excuse to separate them. “Hey! So and so is looking for you! Want to come with me and help find them together?”
<br/>
<div class="bold">Engage After:</div> Checking in on a peer who was harassed. “Hey, what they said was not cool. I wanted to reach out and see how you are feeling, how can I support you?”
<br/>
Let’s practice using the CARE model with the following scenario:   
<br/>
 
<div class="innerHeading">CARE in Action 🐻</div>
<br/>
Your group check-in question asks everyone to share one of their weekend plans. Students go around the room sharing plans with friends or with romantic partners. One student, a man, hesitates at his turn and then says that he and his boyfriend are planning to go to Napa. You hear a groan from the front of the room and hear someone whisper, “I mean, I have gay friends, but I really wish he wouldn’t talk about his sex life. We're not THAT kind of club.” What would you do?
<br/>
<div class="bold">Confront the situation:</div> “What do you mean, that kind of club? We welcome everyone here, and there was nothing inappropriate about what he shared.”
<br/>
<div class="bold">Alert others:</div> “Taylor, as president, do you want to remind us about the norms of our group?”
<br/>
<div class="bold">Redirect attention:</div> “I LOVE Napa… Did you try the Pinot Noir? It’s incredible.”
<br/>
<div class="bold">Engage after:</div> “I’m sorry about what that person said. I want you to know that you are welcome here, and that person does not represent the way that the group feels. We will be addressing it with them individually, if that’s okay with you.”
<br/>
What should you do if you see a potentially harmful situation? The CARE Model provides four easy options for how to intervene. Think of this as a toolkit, not a checklist - which option is best will depend on your personality, and the situation.
<br/>
We encourage each member to be active bystanders. Take action to reduce the chance

<div class="innerHeading">Submit a Report</div>
<br/>
<div class="bolded">Submitting a Report to The Center for Student Conduct</div>
<br/>
The Incident Report form is to report incidents that may be a violation of the Berkeley Campus Code of Student Conduct. If you choose to submit an Incident Report, please be as detailed as possible. You have the option of providing your name or leaving that field blank.  By providing your name, the Center for Student Conduct staff will be able to check in to see how you’re doing, offer support, and seek any clarification to what you shared. Please know if you report anonymously that may limit the options available to respond to the incident.  it will be anonymous and not linked to you. It might not feel easy to decide what to do, so we encourage you to reach out for help if you need it.
