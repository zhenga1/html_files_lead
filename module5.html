<br/>
    <div class="generalHeading">You're almost done...</div>
<br/>
    We commend you for taking on this important role for your organization.
<br/>
    In this training, we covered campus resources, university expectations of student organizations, administrative and ethical responsibilities, and information on how to address and prevent SVSH in your organization. In this last module, we review how to make your signatory status official.
<br/>
    Once you have signatory status, please remember to identify yourself as a signatory to your organization members at an upcoming meeting. Our expectation is that you share the main content of the training and begin to create a culture of care and consent by disseminating the prevention resources from this training.

<br/>
    <b>There are three components to attain signatory status. The first is to take this Signatory training to understand the Signatory role and university expectations as an authorized representative of your organization. The second is to let us know which org(s) you will be serving as a signatory for this year. The last is to accept the Signatory Terms & Conditions in CalLink. The T&Cs confirm your understanding of the Signatory role and serves as your official acceptance of the university policies, procedures, and processes that you and your org will abide by. You know you are a signatory when you see the "Signatory" position assigned to your name on your org's CalLink roster.</b>
<br/>
    <div class="heading2">Final Steps</div>
<br/>
    <div class="info">
        1. Complete the Module 5 Quiz and submit the Google Form to let us know the org(s) for which you will serve as a signatory this year. This officially completes the Signatory Training requirement.
        <br/>
        2. Accept the Signatory Terms & Conditions in CalLink.
    </div>
<div class="info">
    <br/>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;Once your bCourse completion is processed, you will receive an email confirming your signatory status. You will be prompted to accept the Signatory Terms & Conditions in CalLink.
    <br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;You can also find the Terms & Conditions through CalLink memberships:
    <br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click your circular profile on the upper right hand corner
    <br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click Memberships
    <br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scroll down and Select "Review"
    <br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;If you are adding an additional organization to your involvement record we ask you to resubmit the Quiz 5 in this Module.
    <br/>
        If you do not complete the Module 5 Quiz and accept the Terms & Conditions by the 2/10/23 deadline, your organization may be placed in FROZEN status until Fall 2023 if the RSO has not met the minimum of 4 active Signatories.
    <br/>
        <b>If you have questions or need assistance,</b> please email the Student Organization Advising Team at studentorgadvising@berkeley.edu .

<br/>
    <div class="innerHeading">For ASUC/GA Student Government Officials Only (Not RSO members)</div>
<br/>
    All units of the ASUC and GA are not RSOs. As such, all ASUC and GA Officials and Officers need to complete the ASUC/ GA Officials Signatory Eligibility Quiz. The Signatory role is only eligible for ASUC and GA Officials, their Chiefs of Staff, Commissions, and Chartered Programs Leaders. You will not need to re-do the bCourse, but ensure you select the correct quiz. If you have an additional role in an RSO you may still complete the Signatory process for that organization but will need to complete the RSO Module 5 quiz. If you are an ASUC or GA Official and have questions, email studentgovadvising@berkeley.edu.
<br/>
    All other questions about RSOs or Signatories should be directed to the Student Organization Advising Team at studentorgadvising@berkeley.edu .
