<h1>Mission & Values</h1>
The LEAD Center’s mission is to support student-centered learning and development by cultivating student leadership. We advise and engage individuals, student organizations, student government, and various campus communities to enhance the co-curricular experience at UC Berkeley.
Our values are centered on Inclusion, Equity, Sustainability, Excellence, Community, Growth, and Empowerment.
We believe leadership is the continuous process of building authentic relationships, collectively taking bold action, and practicing intentional reflection to create positive change. Our mission is to guide the learning journey of students as they explore leadership and social change in their communities. Our definition of leadership informs our leadership approach.

<h1>What We Do</h1>
The LEAD Center provides the following services:
<div class="info">
    <br/><div class="bold">#Calapalooza</div>: UC Berkeley's twice-a-year student involvement fair. RSOs can recruit and share more information about their organization.
    <br/><div class="bold">Advising:</div> The LEAD Center staff advises student leaders from a variety of topics such as registration, space reservations, campus funding, major event planning, conflict resolution, and university resources.
    <br/><div class="bold">Leadership Development:</div> We host trainings and programs that cultivate learning and growth on a variety of topics among the student leader community.
    <br/><div class="bold">Campus Concierge:</div> We serve as a liaison between students and other campus departments. For example, if your RSO needs to pay the ASUC Student Union for a space reservation, we at the LEAD Center can bridge that connection and solve the issue together.
    <br/><div class="bold">Student Employment:</div> The LEAD Center hires a staff of Peer Leadership Consultants (PLCs) which is a diverse group of student leaders who provide assistance to all communities at the LEAD Center. Their purpose is to provide advising and administrative support to student leaders.

Coronavirus Campus Updates
For the most current information about the university's response to the coronavirus, please refer to coronavirus.berkeley.edu.
Update as of Thursday, June 2, 2022 - 8:30 p.m.
Alameda County has issued a new public health order
Links to an external site.
 requiring that masks be worn in most indoor locations beginning Friday, June 3. Because the city of Berkeley has its own public health jurisdiction, this order does not apply to the city of Berkeley and the UC Berkeley campus. In accordance with CDC and city recommendations, UC Berkeley continues to strongly recommend that masks be worn indoors.
Events
The City of Berkeley Public Health Officer has issued an update to the order requiring proof of vaccination
Links to an external site.
 for patrons and employees of certain businesses.
As of March 11, 2022, City of Berkeley requirements as they pertained to restaurants, gyms and indoor events where food or drink is served, were removed from this Order. Indoor Mega Events, 1,000 attendees or more indoors, should defer to the State’s Mega Event guidance
Links to an external site.
.
The City order now only strongly recommends proof of vaccination verification. So, the UC Berkeley RMT has permited local units/departments that manage indoor spaces where this order applies to choose whether to continue requiring proof of vaccination or not. This permission is only given through May 31, 2022. (Please note: All CalDining facilities and the RSF will no longer require proof of vaccination.)
Local units/departments should assess whether vaccination checking helps or hinders their particular event attendees’ participation. If a manager of a space chooses to continue checking proof of vaccination, care should be taken with communicating with attendees if checking proof of vaccination since it seems that most camps and city locations will no longer be choosing to require proof.
If a manager of a space chooses to continue checking proof of vaccination, the proof of vaccine protocol remains in place and must be followed.
For more information, check out UC Berkeley's Coronavirus Events Page.
At this phase of the pandemic, when managing events, please take into consideration the following:
Each department/division is responsible for the adherence to all COVID-related requirements in effect when hosting a gathering.
Event hosts must keep fully up-to-date on evolving requirements. The key authorities during this pandemic are CA Dept of Public Health, the City of Berkeley Public Health, Cal/OSHA, the UC system, and campus.
Maintain strong communication with your guests.
Venue Managers and event holders must follow current campus policies regarding face-coverings and display signage about the rules. (Note that currently there are far fewer requirements than in the past, you may only have stricter requirements with permission from the RMT.)
Checking for proof of vaccination is only allowed in situations listed in the city’s public health order

 through May 31, 2022, without expressed permission from the RMT. A department does not have to check if it does not wish to (please see update above for more information).
When contracting with third parties, contracts should be reviewed and have appropriate cancelation language, in case public health or operational conditions degrade.
The Events and External Relations Committee continues to be a resource for those trying to plan events. If you have questions, please contact us at: activitiesrecovery@berkeley.edu.
 

<h1>Signatory 101 </h1>
This section covers all the important components of being a signatory. It is important that you understand the administrative and ethical responsibilities that you hold as a student leader. How you navigate your role as a signatory can impact your organization's members. 
<div class="info">
    What is a Signatory?
    Signatories are leaders of your respective organization. We know you will transform our campus through your care, inspiration, dedication, mentorship, and innovation. Berkeley would not be what it is if it weren’t for student leaders like you. We thank you!
    Additionally, as a signatory for your organization, you become the University and LEAD Center authorized representatives of your organization. Signatories voluntarily assume responsibility for the activities and conduct of your organization.

<h1>
    Signatory Requirements
</h1>
<div class="info">
    All (4) signatories must complete this course to learn what it means to be a signatory.
    You must list all orgs for which you intend to serve as a signatory in Module 5 of this course.
    All (4) signatories must accept the Signatory Terms & Conditions for each of their orgs in CalLink.
    You can have a maximum of (8) signatories but feel free to decide what is the right amount for your organization.
    Signatory status must be renewed every academic year. We clear all signatory statuses on June 30th.
    ***ASUC/GA have unique signatory requirements - your Student Government will provide additional information
</div>

<h1>Accepting Your Signatory Terms & Conditions in CalLink</h1>
Once you've completed this Signatory Training bCourse and listed all your orgs in Module 5, the Signatory position will be assigned to your organization's CalLink roster(s). Each signatory will need to accept the Terms & Conditions in CalLink which can be accessed via email from CalLink or through your CalLink memberships. We process signatories weekly so please be patient with the email inviting you to accept your Signatory Terms & Conditions
 
<h1>Signatory Expectations</h1>
Signatories play a crucial role in student communities. As a signatory, you are granted the privilege to reserve space on campus for meetings and events, allowed to apply for funding on behalf of your organization, and manage your organization's CalLink presence. Additionally, when you accept the Signatory Terms & Conditions, you are letting the university know that you've taken this training, understand the significance of serving as your group's authorized representative, and will take responsibility for the organization. The LEAD Center expects signatories to identify themselves as such to the members of their organizations and to share what they learned in this training in a timely manner, particularly the information on harm & violence prevention in student communities.
 
<h1>Signatories' Dual Roles</h1>
Signatories have (2) major areas of their role: <div class="bold">administrative</div> and <div class="bold">ethical</div>.
Administrative responsibilities are all the important logistical and financial components that keep your student organization active, thriving, and registered. We will cover that in Module 2.
Ethical responsibilities refers to the leadership styles and practices that create a safe and inclusive environment for your members. We will review more in Module 3.
